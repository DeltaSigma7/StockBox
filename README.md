## Installation

### Windows setup

#### 1. Download & Extract

- **Download**: Get the latest release (`StockBox_V_XX.zip`) from the [release page](1).
- **Extract**: Unzip all the files and move the folder to your preferred directory.
  - **Tip**: Avoid using `Program` or `Program Files (x86)` to sidestep administrative issues.

#### 2. Adjust the `config.ini` File

- **Locate**: Open the `config.ini` file in the project folder.
- **Configure**: Update the settings to match your environment and preferences. Ensure all required fields, such as database connection details and virtual keyboard settings, are correctly set up.
  - **More Info**: Detailed configuration instructions are provided below.
  - **Default**: By default it's set to a local databse without a virtual keyboard in darkmode with green color

#### 3. You're Done!

- **Run**: With the folder moved and `config.ini` configured, your setup is complete!
  - **Tip**: Create a desktop shortcut for easier access.


### Linux/Debian

- **Update** :Update your system, this may take some time.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```

#### 2. Install TKinter 
- **Install**: Install the Tkinter library for Python.
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

```bash
cd ~/StockBox/StockBox/
pyhton3 StockBox_v_x_x.py
``` 

### Raspberry Pi
The following steps are for setup the code on autostart for a raspberry pi with touchscreen as standalone. I recommend a Raspberry Pi 4b with 4GB Ram. Please following the **Linux-Instrucion** above. 

#### 1. Bash file

- **Create**: For an automatic start setup, first create a bash file.
```bash
sudo nano /usr/bin/autostart_stockbox.sh
```
- **Insert**: add the following lines to the new created file. make sure u enter the right path and version number.
```bash
#!/bin/sh
(sleep 5s && cd /path/to/Stockbox_pyhton-script/ && pyhton StockBox_v_x_x.py) &
exit 0
```

#### 2. `.desktop` file

- **Create**: After creating the bash file, run the following command:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/xdg/autostart/Stockbox_Desktop.desktop
```
- **Insert**: Add the following lines to the newly created file. Make sure to enter the correct path to the already created bash file.
```bash 
[Desktop]
Name=free_choosable_name
Type=Application
Exec=sh /usr/bin/autostart_stockbox.sh (must be the path to the already created bash-file)
Terminal=false
```
After rebooting the system everything should work well.

## Instructions

### Create new enrty
|Option | Description |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| Name | Choose a Name for the item you want to insert into the database| 
| Count | Set a Number of pieces u already own (must be a number)|
| Depot | Type in the storage place|
| Tags | Choose tags so u can search for items seperated by ',' (example: M3, Screw, Metric, Stainless-Steel, DIN-912)| 
| Description | Insert a short description for ur entry, this will be displayed|
| Trigger | Set to a number which reacts as a low stock alert (must be a number)|

### Searchbar Functions:
- Hit the search bar to list all entries.
- Regular searching into tags for precision output.
- Type "D:" into the search bar to search for specific depots, to find objects faster.
- Type "deleted" in the search bar to show all deleted items (items can be restored).

### Import from a `.xslx` file
For a faster setup, first create a `.xlsx.` table. Use the provided `Example_table.xlsx` as a reference. (If you don't use the exact format it wouldnt be working!) he first two entries in the example are just placeholders and can be removed. 
Ensure that the headers and structure remain intact. Only enter digits into the colums Count and Trigger_count. After saving the file, open **StockBox**, go to settings and hit the **import** button. Notice the Message that shows up. Every existing entry will be deleted and **CAN'T** be restored!
Select your `.xlsx.` table and a new database will be created.
